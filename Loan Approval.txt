Loan Approval Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify patterns and factors that influence loan approval decisions. The analysis includes exploratory data visualization, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand the key drivers of loan approvals.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Text: Loan application text description

Income: Applicant's income

Credit_Score: Applicant's credit score (300-850)

Loan_Amount: Requested loan amount

DTI_Ratio: Debt-to-income ratio

Employment_Status: Employed or Unemployed

Approval: Loan approval status (Approved/Rejected)

Key Findings
Employment Status Impact: Employed applicants have significantly higher approval rates

Credit Score Importance: Approval rates increase dramatically with better credit scores

DTI Ratio Threshold: Applications with DTI ratios below 40% have much better approval chances

Loan Purpose Matters: Business and education loans have higher approval rates than vacation or wedding loans

How to Run the Analysis
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python packages (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)

Installation
Clone the repository:
